Lab Activity 1: Overview of Machine Learning Applications
Objective: Familiarize students with various applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

 ### Applications of Machine Learning Across Various Domains
1. Healthcare
2. Finance
3. Marketing

### 1. Healthcare: Personalized Treatment Plans
* **Problem Being Solved:** Patients often respond differently to the same treatments due to genetic, environmental, and lifestyle differences, making one-size-fits-all approaches less effective.
* **Type of Machine Learning Used:** Supervised Learning (regression models) and Unsupervised Learning (clustering).
* **Impact of the Solution:** Machine learning models analyze patient data, including genetic information, medical history, and treatment outcomes, to recommend personalized treatment plans. This leads to more effective therapies, reduced side effects, and improved patient satisfaction by tailoring treatments to individual needs.

### 2. Finance: Credit Scoring and Risk Assessment
* **Problem Being Solved:** Traditional credit scoring methods can be limited and biased, often failing to accurately assess the risk of lending to certain demographics or small businesses.
* **Type of Machine Learning Used:** Supervised Learning (classification and regression).
* **Impact of the Solution:** Machine learning models analyze diverse data sources like transaction history, social media activity, and alternative financial data to create more accurate and inclusive credit scores. This approach helps financial institutions reduce defaults, extend credit to underbanked populations, and improve decision-making in lending.

### 3. Marketing: Sentiment Analysis for Brand Management
* **Problem Being Solved:** Understanding customer sentiment across social media, reviews, and other platforms is challenging due to the vast volume of data and varied expressions of opinions.
* **Type of Machine Learning Used:** Supervised Learning (classification) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* **Impact of the Solution:** Machine learning algorithms analyze text data to gauge customer sentiment toward brands, products, or campaigns. This insight helps companies adjust their marketing strategies, address negative feedback promptly, and enhance their brand image, ultimately driving customer loyalty and sales growth.
